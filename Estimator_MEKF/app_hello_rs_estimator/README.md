# My MEKF for Crazyflie

Rust version of Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter, also contain the "My Lee Controller"

## Architecture
- `src/`: Source code
  - `lib.rs`: Main function, where the controller function is called.
  - `math.rs`: My math library.
  - `myController_lee.rs`: Controller code.
  - `kalman_core.rs`: Estimator code.
  - `estimator_bindings.rs`: State structs generated by bindgen.
  - `stabilizer_types.rs`: abandoned and will not be used anymore.
  
  
## TODO
- Make the functions much more compact and readable.
- The initialization part has an unknown error which will lead to a crash of the drone.
