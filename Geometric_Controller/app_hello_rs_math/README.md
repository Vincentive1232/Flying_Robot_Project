# My Lee Controller for Crazyflie

Rust version of Lee Controller


## Build dependencies

The prerequisite to build the rust app is to have a recent rust compiler (tested with 1.82.0) and the target for the Crazyflie CPU.
To install the target with [rustup](https://rustup.rs):
```
rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```

We need to set crazyflie-firmware as a submodule of the cf-app and change the path of ```CRAZYFILE_BASE``` in the makefile to your own path.

For example:
```
CRAZYFLIE_BASE := /home/vincentlee/Flying_Robot/app_hello_rs_math/crazyflie-firmware
```

Then we can first compile the submodule and then our app by using:
```
cd
cd PATH_TO_APP/crazyflie-firmware
make cf2_defconfig
make -j$(nproc)
cd ..
make
```

## Architecture
- `src/`: Source code
  - `lib.rs`: Main function, where the controller function is called.
  - `math.rs`: My math library.
  - `myController_lee.rs`: Controller code.
  - `stabilizer_types.rs`: State structs generated by bindgen.
  
  
## TODO
The simulator is still not included in this branch.
